## Description

From http://www.runoffgroove.com/mockman.html :

This circuit sounds uncannily reminiscent of the Rockman units from
the 1980s, minus the compression. Distortion is created by overdriving
the op-amps, similar to the Sansamp units. Adding the optional Red
LEDs will result in an even closer copy of the Rockman sound. When
including the LEDs, reduce the 470k resistors to avoid
over-distorting. You can also increase the 10k resistor for less
overdrive.
